        <p class="about-me">Hello! I'm Rhiannan, a third year Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute
            of Technology. I am pursuing a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and People. I have 
            mostly back-end development experience, but will be working with front-end and back-end this year
            to become a well-rounded full-stack developer. This is my first time building a website from 
            scratch and I know I have a lot to learn, and I look forward to learning!<br>I would describe myself
            as a intellectually curious and always seeking new heights. I enjoy creating and contributing to 
            things and solving problems. I love painting and playing video games. It is a dream of mine to be 
            able to construct my own PC this year to be able to enjoy video games some more.
