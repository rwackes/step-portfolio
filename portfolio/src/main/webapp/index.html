      <h3 class="about-title">About Me</h3>
      <p class="about-me">Hello! I'm Rhiannan, a third year Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute
          of Technology. I am pursuing a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and People. I have 
          mostly back-end development experience, but will be working with front-end and back-end this year
          to become a well-rounded full-stack developer. This is my first time building a website from 
          scratch and I know I have a lot to learn, but I look forward to learning!<br>I was first introduced
          to computer science in high school when I took Intro to Programming and AP Computer Science my final 
          years, where I found an interest in computer programming. Throughout my college experience, I have 
          become increasingly more passionate about touching the lives of others through software.<br>
          I would describe myself as intellectually curious and always seeking new heights. I enjoy 
          creating and contributing to things and solving problems. I was born in Puerto Rico and lived there 
          for thirteen years until I moved to Maryland, where I currently reside. Some of my hobbies include 
          painting, listening to music, and playing video games. It is a dream of mine to be able to build my 
          own PC gaming system by the end of this year to be able to enjoy playing video games some more.<br>
